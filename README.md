This is the Character Relationship Map Drawer.

It's a tool that automates drawing character relationships maps, which are diagrams that show how characters (usually in a fictional work) are related in whatever way is desired by the user (usually due to being relevant to the plot).

For example, you could use this to depict:

• How everyone in a family is related (e.g. sibling bond, parent-child bond, cousin, etc.);

• How a circle of co-workers know each other (job only, friends outside of the job, etc.);

• How soap opera characters perceive each other romantically (dated, never dated, want to date but can't, etc.);

• All of the above at once;

• And more!

CRMD just requires that you put in an Excel sheet explaining who the characters are and what each pair is that has a bond, and the program will draw it!

As an example of such an Excel sheet, you can download, use, or modify as you see fit the Sample Sheet. This sheet draws a set of familial relationships from near the beginning of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice as an example of what you, the user, could use it for. You can then delete the Austen-specific cells from this sheet and replace them with whatever you like.

Have fun!
