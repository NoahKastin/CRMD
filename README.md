This is the Character Relationship Map Drawer.

It's a tool that automates drawing character relationships maps, which are diagrams that show how characters (usually in a fictional work) are related in whatever way is desired by the user (usually due to being relevant to the plot).

For example, you could use this to depict:

• How everyone in a family is related (e.g. sibling bond, parent-child bond, cousin, etc.);

• How a circle of co-workers know each other (job only, friends outside of the job, etc.);

• How soap opera characters perceive each other romantically (dated, never dated, want to date but can't, etc.);

• All of the above at once;

• And more!

CRMD just requires that you put in an Excel sheet explaining who the characters are and what each pair is that has a bond, and the program will draw it!

Have fun!
